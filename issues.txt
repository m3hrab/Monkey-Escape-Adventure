1. (Not possible at the moment, Explain in details below) The first thing is the screen. It would be better if the user could maximize the window.(not possible at this moment)
2. (Solved) The leopard only moves when the monkey does. xd sorry for the miss understanding :p

7. (Solved) After completing the last level (level3) the game should not ask "Chcete pokračovať na další level? 
8. (Solved) Add "correct icon" button on the game completion screen
9. (Trying to find good leopard assets in online) Increase the Leopard Size


The main reason it's not possible to implement a responsive screen (where users can minimize or maximize) at the moment.
is that I've already calculated the dimensions of every game element (tiles, monkey, leopards, button,
scores, lives, etc.) based on a fixed screen size ratio. However, transitioning 
to a responsive screen requires recalculating the dimensions of each game element 
relative to the screen size, which becomes so challenging after building the game for a fixed-size screen.
